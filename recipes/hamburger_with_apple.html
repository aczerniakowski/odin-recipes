        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These hamburgers with grilled apple and chili crisp are juicy and delicious. For your summer grilling, level up beef patties with grilled sweet-tart apples and thick-cut onions and chili-crisp mayo.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2 red apples, cored (such as Fuji, Gala, or Pink Lady) </b></li>
                <li><b>1 pound ground beef</b></li>
                <li><b>1/4 cup fine dry breadcrumbs</b></li>
                <li><b>1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili crisp, divided, plus more for serving </b></li>
                <li><b>1/2 teaspoon salt</b></li>
                <li><b>2 (1/3-inch) slices red onion</b></li>
                <li><b>4 hamburger buns</b></li>
                <li><b>1/4 cup mayonnaise</b></li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice 1 apple using a mandoline slicer to create 8 (1/4-inch-thick) slices. Shred any remaining scraps plus all or part of the second apple to get 1/2 cup shredded apple. Squeeze shredded apple to extract some of the moisture. Reserve any remaining apple for another use. </li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to 190 degrees C)).</li>
                <li>Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple in a bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack patties.</li>
                <li>Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered, carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill onion slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. If you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. When onions are cool enough to handle, separate rings.</li>
                <li>Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices. Serve with additional chili crisp</li>
            </ol>
